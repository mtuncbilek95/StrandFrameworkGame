# StrandFramework Engine's Test Game Project

This is the test game development project I created for my custom modular game engine called StrandFramework. The engine will be private till I make sure it's 
big enough and product ready. 

Of course, this repo will be a template for Create EmptyProject. Then, I will create templates for anyone who wants to make game in both Linux and Windows. Since
I dealt with Windows SDK a lot, I decided to develop the game engine on Arch Linux(CachyOS). 

## THE DOCUMENTATION WILL BE THERE FOR YOU TO CREATE YOUR GAMES WITHOUT HAVING A HEART ATTACK :) BUT I WILL GIVE YOU ABSOLUTE PAIN SINCE THE ENGINE WON'T HAVE A OUT OF BOX RENDER PIPELINE LIKE UNREAL OR UNITY SDRP.
